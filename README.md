# Description
- Every chart, figure, and microscope slide in a scientific paper tells a story. But today, that story may be fake. Copy-move forgery—where regions of an image are duplicated to fabricate results—is one of the most common and damaging types of scientific misconduct. These forgeries can mislead researchers, waste time and funding, and undermine trust in entire fields of study.
- Most detection still relies on expert reviewers manually scanning papers, or on digital forensics tools that weren’t built with scientific figures in mind. Both approaches fall short in biomedical research. Manual review is slow and impossible to scale, and most automated detectors struggle to cope with the complexity of scientific figures. What’s missing is a tool built specifically for this domain.
- In this competition, you’ll develop models that detect and segment copy-move forgeries in biomedical images. The benchmark is based on several hundred confirmed forgeries pulled from more than 2,000 retracted papers, making it one of the most realistic and detailed datasets in scientific image forensics. You’ll be evaluated on how well your model finds and separates copied regions at the pixel level.
- If successful, your work won’t just flag suspicious figures. It could help reshape the way journals, reviewers, and institutions verify published science by detecting misconduct before it spreads.
- Let’s keep science honest, one pixel at a time.
